I am a PhD student at <a href='https://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/'>Trinity Hall</a>, University of Cambridge, working with <a href='https://guillen-it.github.io'> Prof. Albert Guillén i Fàbregas</a>. 
I am a member of the
<a href="https://psi2.eng.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Probabilistic Systems, Information, and Inference</a> (PSI<sup>2</sup>) Group within the Division of
<a href="https://divf.eng.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Information Engineering</a>.
My doctoral studies are generously supported by the Cambridge Trust.
Prior to joining Cambridge, I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href='https://en.sharif.ir/'> Sharif University of Technology</a>, where I studied Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics.
<br>
<br>
I am broadly interested in <b>information theory</b> {Shannon theory, random coding, error exponents}, <b>applied probability</b>, and <b>combinatorics</b>.
