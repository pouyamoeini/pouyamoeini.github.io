I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge working with <a href='https://guillen-it.github.io'> Prof. Albert Guillén i Fàbregas</a>. 
I am grateful to be generously supported by the Cambridge Trust.
Prior to joining Cambridge, I completed my undergraduate studies at Sharif University of Technology, where I studied Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics.
<br>
I am broadly interested in information theory {Shannon theory, random coding, error exponents}, applied probability, and combinatorics.
